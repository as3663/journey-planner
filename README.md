# journey-planner

The journey planner has been created by Amirali Zahedi, Arron Lohia, Pouria Sabouri and Jenish Paudel. We have used the Northern Line from the TFL service
as our reference for the code, furthermore we have made it fairly simple but yet easy to use and easy to access/understand if a user would like to see
our code.
